# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

cat and dog classification using vgg19

VGG19 is a convolutional neural network architecture that was introduced by the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford in 2014. It is an extension of the VGG16 architecture, with the addition of four more convolutional layers.

The VGG19 architecture consists of 19 layers, including 16 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are organized into five blocks, each containing multiple 3x3 convolutional layers, followed by a max pooling layer. The first two blocks have two convolutional layers each, while the remaining three blocks have four convolutional layers each.

VGG19 was trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over one million images belonging to 1000 different classes. The network achieved very good performance on this dataset, with a top-5 error rate of 7.3%.

VGG19 has been used as a pre-trained model for a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. It has also been used as a feature extractor for tasks such as style transfer and image retrieval.
